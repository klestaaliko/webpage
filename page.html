             varied and scenic landscapes on Earth and is often described as a country

        <p>Greece, the southernmost of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.
             Geography has greatly influenced the country’s development. 
             Mountains historically restricted internal communications, but the sea
              opened up wider horizons. The total land area of Greece (one-fifth of
               which is made up of the Greek islands)
             is comparable in size to England or the U.S. state of Alabama.</p>
